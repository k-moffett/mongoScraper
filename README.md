_Mongo Scraper_
<br>
Currently this app is scraping an npr site and storing the articles' titles, previews, and link inside a mongodb.
<br>
This app still needs to render the articles dynamically through react. Users will then be able to leave comments associated with each article. There will be a one-to-many relationship between the article and its comments.
